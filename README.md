# trailsV2
It's about trails and errors. But I will step forward on this trail of Sofeware Engineer.
This is a part of the path to create a fullstack application.
At the moment, I allows user to view all the trail in database, create a new one, or edit the existing trail.
Users are allowed to input a link to an image of the trail so that could encourage the other users to step into the trails.
In the future, it would have more features added. The planed features are login/registration, input more images into any trail.
